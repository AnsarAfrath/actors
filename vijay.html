  In February 2024, actor-politician Vijay revealed something that was doing the speculation rounds. In a statement announcing the launch of his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, Vijay also shared that he was bidding adieu to his three-decade-old acting career. Many expressed their sadness about this decision, many others were jubilant about the launch of the political outfit, and there were the others who believed it could just be a temporary decision, and not a permanent move.
